The contents uploaded for this project are concerned with upscaling of reservoir from fine-scaled to coarse-scaled. The softwares used for this projects are MATLAB, ECLIPSE100, PETREL.
These 3 softwares were dependent on each other to produce a desire result which is to simulate the hydrocarbon production data with optimised RF/UR by producing relevant data such as GOR, Water Cut,
Saturation Profile, Production Plateau etc.

The contents uploaded here are mainly focused on upscaling of the reservoir using MATLAB. The aims and objectives are described as follow:

Aims 
* To shrink the dimension of 120:60:10 into 60:30:10 (Z-direction layers are input as unchanged due to the importance of reservoir thickness for simulation)
* To generate a MATLAB code that can execuete Flow-based or Analytical upscaling method by generating coarse-scale reservoir layers
* To transform the resutant datum into GRDECL format, use them in ECLIPSE100 software to execute field production simulation, develop the model further with
  modification of wells-placement and a choice of secondary reservoir depletion method
* To generate field data in PETREL (GOR, watercut, production plateu, saturation profile)
* To narrow down the error margin of fine-scaled simulation data Vs coarse-scaled simulation data

Objectives
* To tackle the complication of flow-based upscaling coding in MATLAB
* To challenge the error margin to be as narrow as possible
* To examine geological uncertainties
* To analyse comparisons between different secondary reservoir depletion methods
